<a name="solution-header" class="anchor" href="#solution-header"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>DC Community Resources Data: The Solution.</h3>

<p>By collaborating across sectors and stakeholders, we have merged multiple different directory datasets into one comprehensive database that includes all of the non-profit agencies and public services in DC. This database is hosted on the Open Data DC catalog and <a href="http://opendatadc.org/api/3/action/datastore_search?resource_id=81d74b9f-6793-469a-b47d-a097d8ca3a86">you can access it here</a>.</p>

<p>But rather than trying to build the perfect application to serve this data, we believe that a truly effective solution must instead establish this service directory as a cooperative, shared resource, open to an ecology of community stakeholders and applications.</p>

<p>We can do this by creating a cloud-based data catalog that can serve up the directory&mdash;and even receive updates&mdash;from external collaborators. This approach will make it much easier for anyone to develop a directory service specifically designed for their community’s particular needs.</p>

<h3>
<a name="path-forward" class="anchor" href="#path-forward"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>A Path Forward.</h3>

<p><strong>1) Establish a common data pool</strong> by merging multiple local databases into a single consolidated file in which each organization is assigned a unique ID. <strong>We have already accomplished this step!</strong> <a href="http://opendatadc.org/api/3/action/datastore_search?resource_id=81d74b9f-6793-469a-b47d-a097d8ca3a86">The data is available here</a>, served openly via API.</p>

<p><strong>2) Apply an “open” taxonomy</strong> to organize the common data pool. Currently, there’s no established order for the entries in our consolidated directory, but we may be able to use <a href="http://openeligibility.org">OpenEligibility.org</a>, a recently introduced open source social service taxonomy. If it’s deemed to be viable, this <em>open taxonomy</em> could be a common standard through which different applications could share the same points of reference.</p>

<p><strong>3) Establish a cooperative plan</strong> for the sustained viability of the common data pool. This step could potentially entail the formation of a “data cooperative”: a membership organization offering premium services to all local entities for a fee or for commitment of time for data management. <em>See <a href="http://datacommons.find.coop/vision">this recnet example of a "data cooperative."</a></em></p>

<p><strong>4) Demonstrate potential through initial applications</strong>, such as mobile information-and-referral services; feature-rich software for case managers and social workers; a <a href="http://districtcommons.org">LocalWiki</a> that serves the structured data alongside unstructured space for users to contribute "tacit" knowledge, etc.</p>

<p><strong>5) Engage users in participation</strong>, through an accompanying set of social programs, anchored in various community spaces and designed for various levels of skills and purposes. For instance: resource mapping projects in social service agencies and civic associations; digital literacy training through "wiki parties" at libraries; and regular “hackathon”-style opportunities for experimentation with diverse user groups.</p>

<p>By sharing an open, common directory of DC’s community resources, we can greatly improve access to critical services. In the long run, we can enhance our collective capacity to understand and make decisions about how resources are allocated in our communities.</p>

<p>The DC Community Resource Data working group is an ad hoc table of people and organizations interested in solving this problem together. You should join us! We are looking for community leaders, health and social workers, data geeks, and anyone who wants to learn about how these things work and how we can make them better. <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!members/dcresourceplatform">Join our Google group email list here.</a> <a href="http://meetup.com/cfabrigade/Washington-DC/">Join the Code for DC Meetup here.</a></p>
