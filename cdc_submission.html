<h3>Are there Community Services where there is Poverty?</h3>

<br>
<br>
<p>Using the 2012 CPS data for household size and income,
we estimated the poverty rate per geographic region (MSA) for the largest cities
based on the federal poverty guidelines (e.g. $23,050 income threshold for a household of 4).
We compared this to the presence of community workers (most of the BLS O*NET occupations under 'Community and Social Service Occupations'),
as defined and measured by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).  </p>

<p>There are about 1.9M people employed nationally in community and social service occupations, including all types of counselors and social workers. About a quarter (260K) work for local and state governments, and 190K in schools. The BLS data provides more depth into these occupations, which we can utilize in the future.</p>

<p>We found a mismatch between areas of poverty, and density of community workers. In Dallas, LA, and Miami, there are over 60 people in poverty per community worker. In Boston, Philadelphia, and Seattle, there are less than 25. There is an inverse relationship between the density (either by % of population, or % of employed) of community workers and potential people in need. We're not sure how much of this is due to budgetary limitations, but this shows great opportunity for a resource directory to identify and target the regional mismatches.</p>
