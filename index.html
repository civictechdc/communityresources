<h3>Welcome to DC Community Resource Data.</h3>

<p>When someone in our community is in need of some kind of assistance, it’s hard to know what resources are available to them. It shouldn’t be. We can fix this. </p>

<h3>The Problem.</h3>
<p>The District of Columbia lacks an easy way to collect and share information about the many community resources (health care, social services, food assistance, legal counsel, etc) that are available to residents in need. DC government agencies, non-profits, and community networks publish a variety of directories, but these directories are produced in siloes, and they struggle to stay complete and up to date This is wasteful and ineffective; we can do better.</p>

<h3><strong><a href="/solution.html">A Solution.</a></strong></h3>

<p>Rather than trying to build the perfect application to serve this data, we believe that a truly effective solution must instead make service directory data <i>openly available</i> (i.e. accessible without cost for re-use and repurposing) to an ecosystem of applications and stakeholders.</p> <p>The big question is, 'how are we going to maintain the data over time?' Well we're going to figure that out, together.</p>
