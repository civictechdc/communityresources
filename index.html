<h3>Welcome to DC Community Resources Data.</h3>

<p>When someone in our community is in need of some kind of assistance, it’s hard to know what resources are available to them. It shouldn’t be. We can fix this. </p>

<h3>The Problem.</h3>

<p>The District of Columbia lacks an easy way to aggregate and share information about the many community resources (health care, social services, food assistance, legal counsel, etc) that are available to residents in need. DC government agencies, non-profits, and community networks publish a variety of directories, but these directories are produced independently, so they struggle to stay complete and up to date, and few (if any) of them share information with each other. This is wasteful and ineffective; we can do better.</p>

<h3><strong><a href="/communityresources/solution.html">A Solution.</a></strong></h3>

<p>By collaborating across sectors and stakeholders, we have merged multiple different directory datasets into one comprehensive database that includes all of the non-profit agencies and public services in DC. But rather than trying to build the perfect application to serve this data, we believe that a truly effective solution must instead establish this service directory as a cooperative, shared resource, open to an ecology of community stakeholders and applications. <a href="/communityresources/solution.html">Read more.</a></p>

<h3>How to get involved.</h3>

<p>We are an ad hoc group of people and organizations who are interested in solving this problem together. You should join us! We are looking for community leaders, health and social workers, data geeks, and anyone who wants to learn about how these things work and how we can make them better. <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!members/dcresourceplatform">Join our Google group email list here.</a> <a href="http://meetup.com/cfabrigade/Washington-DC/">Join the Code for DC Meetup here.</a></p>
