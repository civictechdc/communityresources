<p>When someone in our community is in need of some kind of assistance, it’s hard to know what resources are available to them. It shouldn’t be. We can fix this. </p>

<h3>
<a name="the-problem" class="anchor" href="#the-problem"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Problem.</h3>

<p>Collectively, the District of Columbia lacks an easy way to aggregate and share information about the many community resources (health care, social services, food assistance, legal counsel, etc) that are available to residents in need. There are a variety of directories published by government agencies, nonprofits and community networks, but these directories are produced independently, so each one struggles to be complete and up-to-date, and few (if any) of them share information with each other. This status quo is wasteful and ineffective; we can do better. Read more.</p>

<h3>
<a name="a-solution" class="anchor" href="#a-solution"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>A Solution.</h3>

<p>Through a cross-sector, multi-stakeholder collaboration, the DC Community Resource Data working group has merged multiple different directory datasets into one comprehensive database that includes all of the non-profit agencies and public services in the District of Columbia. But rather than trying to build the ‘Perfect Application’ to serve this data, we believe that a truly effective solution must instead establish this service directory as <i>a commons</i> -- a cooperatively shared resource, open to an ecology of community stakeholders and applications.

<h3>
<a name="how-to-get-involved" class="anchor" href="#how-to-get-involved"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How to get involved.</h3>

<p>The DC Community Resource Data working group is an ad hoc table of people and organizations interested in solving this problem together. You should join us! We are looking for community leaders, health and social workers, data geeks, and anyone who wants to learn about how these things work and how we can make them better.</p>
